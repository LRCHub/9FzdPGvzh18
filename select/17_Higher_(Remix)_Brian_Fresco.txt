You don't, you don't need no one
You don't, you don't need no one
You don't, you don't need no one
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need no one else
Say you don't
Say you don't

Say you don't need no nobody else
In the back of the club with a sack rolled up
We don't need nobody's help
Cashmere sweater got my typing on her leather
Like "Shawty come take this sip"
I done watch you powder your nose
See the waves from the song gon' make you dip
I've been drinking all night
I've been watching all night
You've been moving it right and that dress is so tight
Mr. DJ keep playing, my itching, I'm hyped
Baby, tell me we gon' make love song tonight
Yeah that was both of me, liquor be right
Just promise that you'll take me higher alright
Do me like it's just the last time I write
Keep thinking (?)

We gon', we gon', we gon', we gon' take me higher
We gon', we gon', we gon', we gon' take me higher

Say you want me
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me
That you don't need nobody else

And I don't need nobody else
Got my hand on her b--t like "baby what's up"
Trying woo a young boy in the crib
Don't she whine in the club
Red heels, bottom scuffed
Don't care cause you know it's so lit
We done danced around ninety two songs
Slow Jamz on, baby girl let's dip
I roll up in foreign car out the cut
Let the plus keep us up
She keep calling me nuts
She keep claiming she drunk, baby blame it on us
Like a (?), got me feeling like love
And the circle of love, tonight girl you're the one
Every girl in this club, like shawty you're the one
Telling my homies like shawty what's up
She's telling her friends like I tell them what's up

Say you want me
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me
Now you don't need nobody else

We gon', we gon', we gon', we gon' take me higher
We gon', we gon', we gon', we gon' take me higher

Say you don't need nobody else
Say you don't need nobody else

I want the bad one
I want the, I want the one with the sew in
I want the mad one
The one with the attitude
She from the low end
She wanna argue
She want to turn in, she want to go there
She get in flow now
Get her a chauffer, get her from old hair
Look at her face, she's so over it
Baby I pay all the mortgages
Bring her to Yoda like "oh you're wise"
(?) and you over (?)
Skin, I keep the eggs over-easy
Keep the stones way, way over me
I keep her legs like overseas
I keep the (?) like (?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell the waitress couple cases
When you smoking dope with me
You can smoke in public places
You can skip a couple steps
You could steal a couple bases
Couple friends, couple chasers
You don't need nobody big

Say you want me
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me
Now you don't need nobody else
Say you want me
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me
Now you don't need nobody else
